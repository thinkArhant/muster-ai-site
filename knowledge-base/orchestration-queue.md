# Orchestration Queue
<!-- This file tells the founder which agent to invoke next. PM populates at sprint planning. Agents update on session completion. -->
<!-- Protocol: See muster/system-guide.md → Invocation Patterns and Agent Communication Protocol. -->

## Prompt Standard

<!-- Authoring or editing a step? The format templates + Role:-marker rules live in `muster/team/pm/skills/generic/sprint-planning.md` → "Queue Step Format". The live steps below already demonstrate the format, and `muster-queue-lint.sh` enforces the structure. -->

## Founder Decisions
<!-- Agents add questions requiring founder input here. -->
<!-- PM monitoring: scan this section at every session start. Entries older than 24h without founder response are flagged to the founder immediately. -->
<!-- Format: - [DATE] [Agent]: [Question] -->
<!-- Autonomous runs: this section is non-halting on its own — observation and scope escalations park here while the loop keeps running. PM is the sole party that summons the founder: only PM (after assessing a block per the Decision Autonomy Matrix) writes the question here AND sets the Next Step block's `Role:` to `halt` (see below). A specialist that hits a block routes it to a `Role: pm` assessment step instead of halting. There is no checkbox convention. -->

## Next Step
<!-- The single next agent invocation. Copy the ENTIRE code block (including `Role: <agent>` at the top) and paste as one message in Claude Code. -->
<!-- The `Role:` marker tells you which tab to open. Multi-tab: open a tab in that role (picker → matching role) and paste; bound role executes the task body directly. Single-tab from PM: paste in PM tab; PM reads the `Role:` marker and explicitly invokes Agent tool with `subagent_type=<role>`. -->
<!-- Autonomous hard-block signal: PM sets `Role: halt` here (and records the question in `## Founder Decisions`) when it has assessed a block as needing a founder answer. Specialists never set `Role: halt` themselves — a blocked specialist re-points Next Step to a `Role: pm` assessment step and PM decides handle-vs-escalate. The autonomous loop (`muster/scripts/muster-sprint-run.sh`) stops on `Role: halt`. Sprint completion is detected by the ABSENCE of a fenced code block under Next Step (matching the `MUSTER_ROLE=auto` contract in `muster/CLAUDE.md`) — a whitespace block or a human-readable "sprint complete" placeholder both read as complete. A block that has a fence but no `Role:` line defaults to `pm`. -->

## Upcoming
<!-- Ordered sequence of remaining steps for this sprint. -->

## Done (Last 10)
<!-- Completed steps, newest at the top. Growth rules: Done keeps max 10 entries (trim oldest on overflow). PM clears Done entirely at each new sprint. -->
<!-- Format: - [DATE] [Agent]: [One-line summary] -->
<!-- A specialist Done entry is a POINTER to the handoff, not a substitute for it: `- DATE — Step N: <title> (HO-NNN). <one-line outcome>.` If it grows past ~5 lines, the detail belongs in the HO body. The autonomous loop lints the most-recent Done entry's HO reference against agent-requests.md and stops if it's missing. -->
